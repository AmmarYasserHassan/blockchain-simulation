# Blockchain Simulation

This was a university project done in collaboration with [Omar Kamal](https://github.com/oakamel) and [Omar Salah](https://github.com/omartarek28) with the purpose of simulating the inner workings of the [bitcoin](bitcoin.org) network.

In this project we provide a [java](https://www.oracle.com/java/) implementation to an even more modified and secure blockchain than that of bitcoinâ€™s and we provide a simple console-based simulation for the interactions between nodes in the network.
